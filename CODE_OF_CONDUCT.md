# Code of Conduct

Coding Confessions sessions should be safe spaces to encourage people to be honest about their failures. Our confession guidelines provide some ground rules to ensure that confessions are honest, helpful, and blameless. Should you run a Coding Confessions session yourself, we highly recommend having a Code of Conduct for your event.

A Code of Conduct is a set of rules that guides behaviour. There might already be an existing Code of Conduct that applies to your event set out by the hosting institution or community. 

If no Code of Conduct applies to your event yet, below are some examples that we can recommend as a starting point for creating your own.
 * [ReproHack Code of Conduct](https://github.com/reprohack/reprohack-hq/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

 ## Guidelines for absolvers
 
As an absolver, you should ensure that any information you receive is treated confidentially but still provides lessons learnt to the wider community. We thus recommend that any documentation of confessions received at in person events or in online conversations follow the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule)
> "participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s) [...] may be revealed."
