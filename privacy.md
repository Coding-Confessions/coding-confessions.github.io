### About us

The Coding Confessions project evolved as part of a hack day event at the [Collaborations Workshop 2021](https://www.software.ac.uk/cw21). The team that created the project and this page are Colin Sauze, Dave Horsfall, Eirini Zormpa, and Patricia Herterich. We don't track information on this page and Confession submissions are anonymous unless submitters are happy to have their name attached to a confession.
