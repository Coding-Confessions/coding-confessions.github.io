# What is a Coding Confession?

Simply put: "Where somebody admits to mistakes or bad practice in code they've developed."

See [https://coding-confessions.github.io/](https://coding-confessions.github.io/) for more information.

This project was created at the Software Sustainability Institute's 2021 Collaborations Workshop by Colin Sauze, Dave Horsfall, Eirini Zormpa and Patricia Herterich.
