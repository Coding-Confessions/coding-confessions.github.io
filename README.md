# What is a Coding Confession?

Simply put: "Where somebody admits to mistakes or bad practice in code they've developed."

## What's the problem?

Everybody who develops software has at some point written some software badly, quickly, cut corners or simply made a mistake that made it function incorrectly. Due to [imposter syndrome](https://dev.to/kevinhickssw/even-senior-developers-have-imposter-syndrome-4e8f) many people feel like this makes them less worthy developers. 

Often the root cause is time pressure to make something that "just works" (or at least appeared to). These little short cuts often end up becoming core pieces of software upon which research conclusions and publications are based. People don't like to admit to making mistakes, cutting corners or not following best practice, sometimes hiding these problems away. 

## Why do this?

* Change the culture of research so that mistakes can be disclosed without fear.
* Document mistakes and allow the entire community to benefit from the lessons learned. These will be published on our [blog](blog).

## How do I make a confession?

Please only submit a confession about something you did yourself, don't submit confessions about the work of others. 

Send us one paragraph about each of the following:
* The background to the problem, what were you trying to do? 
* The mistake you made.
* What steps can be taken to avoid this mistake in the future.

You can do this publicly or privately.

See [example blog](exampleblog) for an example of a blog post. 
We will publish your confession on our [blog](https://coding-confessions.github.io/blog). 

### Public Confessions

Choose this if:

* You are willing to publicly disclose your confession.
* You are confident that doing this isn't going to ruin your career.

This option is best if:
  * The mistake happened some time ago.
  * You're a more senior member of staff with a secure job.

To make a public confession please submit an issue to the coding confessions github repository. Add the label "public confession". Enter your three paragraphs into the issue text. We will reformat it to place it on the blog. 

### Private Confessions
* You want to disclose a confession but don't want to be publicly named.

This option is best if:
  * This mistake happened recently.
  * You are worried about the implications for your career.

Please fill out this [Google Form](https://forms.google.com) with details of your confession. Do not include any identifying information such as your name, employer/organisation, links to publications or code repositories. 


## Running a Coding Confessions event

As well as submitting your confession to us, you can run your own coding confessions event at your organisation or as part of a conference. We have three possible styles for this: public talks, "confession booths" and noticeboards. 

Its really helpful if the outputs of these are fed back to our blog for everybody to benefit from. This could either be in the form of a post for each confession or a summary post covering any commonly occuring themes. Either way please submit an issue to our github repository and label it "event confession". 

### Notice board

This style requires the least effort to manage. A notice board is setup for people to attach their confessions written on postit notes or larger pieces of paper if required.

#### Online Noticeboards

For online conferences an anonymous document editing system such as an [etherpad](https://etherpad.org/) or [hackmd](https://hackmd.io/#) could be used instead. 

### Public Talks

Here each person wishing to confess has a few minutes to talk about their confession. Our suggested format is a lightning talk style where:

* Each person gets 5 minutes to speak
* Maximum of 3 slides
* 2 minutes for questions

Volunteers to confess could either be identified in advance or requested at the time (or a few hours in advance if slides are needed). The first option requires more planning but guarantees you've got some people to speak. 

### Confession Booths

In this option the person giving the confession (the confessor) and the person listening to them (the absolver) sit together in a room with some kind of barrier to prevent them from seeing each other, but allowing them to hear each other. This could be a curtain or a screen. 

This option needs at least two people to run it. One to act as the "absolver" who will listen to the confessions. The other to ensure that nobody else enters the room while the confession is taking place. The absolver should have some experience in mentoring. Please see our code of conduct for absolvers. 

This style of confession allows the confessor to tell their story without judgement. But unless something is recorded it doesn't allow the lessons to be presented to the wider community. The absolver could (with permission of the confessor) write down some notes which could form the basis of a blog post. Or for a more anonymous approach, they could write a blog covering only the broad themes which were confessed to them. 

#### Online confession booths
For online conferences there will need to be a place that the confessor can anonymously chat with the absolver. This could be achieved with an anonymous platform that does not require a login such as [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/). The confessor should not give their name or switch on their camera and could even opt to say everything via a text chat. The absolver could reply via text or audio.
