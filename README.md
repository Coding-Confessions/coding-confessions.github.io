# What is a Coding Confession?

Simply put: "Where somebody admits to mistakes or bad practice in code they've developed."

See [https://coding-confessions.github.io/](https://coding-confessions.github.io/) for more information.

This project was created at the [Software Sustainability Institute's 2021 Collaborations Workshop](https://software.ac.uk/cw21) by Colin Sauze, Dave Horsfall, Eirini Zormpa and Patricia Herterich.

# Run your own coding confession event

See [https://coding-confessions.github.io/events.html](https://coding-confessions.github.io/events.html) for more information. We welcome feedback on your experiences of running coding confessions via a github issue.
