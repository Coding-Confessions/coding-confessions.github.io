# What is a Coding Confession?

Simply put: "Where somebody admits to mistakes or bad practice in code they've developed."


## What's the problem?

Everybody who develops software has at some point written some software badly, quickly or cut corners. This is often because they were under time pressure to make something that "just works" (or at least appeared to). These little short cuts often end up becoming core pieces of software upon which research conclusions and publications are based. People don't like to admit to making mistakes, cutting corners or not following best practice, sometimes hiding these problems away. 

## Why do this?

* Change the culture of research so that mistakes can be disclosed without fear.
* Document mistakes and allow the entire community to benefit from the lessons learned.
