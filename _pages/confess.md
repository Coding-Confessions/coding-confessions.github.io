We offer two types of confession, public confessions which will be attributable to you or private confessions which are anonymous. If you wish to remain anonymous, do not include any identifying information such as your name, employer, links to publications or code repositories.

To complete the form, you will need to send us one paragraph about each of the following

- The background to the problem, what were you trying to do?
- The mistake you made
- What steps can be taken to avoid this mistake in the future

Please only submit a confession about something you did yourself, don't submit confessions about the work of others.

You can browse our [previous confessions]({% link _pages/confessions.md %}) for examples.

### Public Confessions

You should submit a public confession if:

- You are willing to publicly disclose your confession.
- You are confident that doing this isn't going to ruin your career.

This option is best if:

- The mistake happened some time ago.
- You're a more senior member of staff with a secure job.

### Private Confessions

You should submit a private confession if you want to disclose a confession but don't want to be publicly named.

This option is best if:

- This mistake happened recently.
- You are worried about the implications for your career.
